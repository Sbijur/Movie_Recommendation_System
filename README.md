# Movie_Recommendation_System

The rise of OTT and online streaming services has allowed for not only for the
creation of new avenues for movies, but has also created its own following. The
ever-increasing numbers of the films and other media formats on such platforms
has made obtaining movies for users, using existing technology, very difficult.
Due for this reason, users and platform developers have been looking for a
program that can efficiently and correctly recommend movies to its users, based
on their previous choices in the same. However, many recommendation systems
use shared browsing methods to predict user requirements as a result of this
method provide a very accurate prediction. Today, many researchers are
focused on developing a number of ways to improve accuracy instead rather
than using collaborative browsing methods. Therefore, in order to improve the
accuracy of recommendation program, we present the recommender system, kclique method and KNN algorithm. The performance results show that the
proposed methods improve more accuracy of the movie recommendation
system than any other methods used in this experiment.
